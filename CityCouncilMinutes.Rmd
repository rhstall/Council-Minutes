## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tokenizers)
library(text2vec)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(glmnet)
library(doParallel)
library(Matrix)
library(broom)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(devtools)
library(ggrepel)
library(apcluster)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
library(textreuse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Import file for Reading

The first thing we need to do is to read and load the files into the system. This is a test using the combined minutes of 2023.

```{r}
setwd("~/Google Drive/Clemson PDBE/Dissertation/CityCouncilMinutes")
minutes2023 <- read_file("~/Google Drive/Clemson PDBE/Dissertation/CityCouncilMinutes/2023/x2023.txt")
#print(minutes2023)
```

Note: Is there a way to delete the line breaks?

## **Stop Words**

### Remove Headers and Titles

City Council minutes are confused by the number of titles and headings. These need to be removed.

```{r}

stop_words = c("FORMAL MEETING OF CITY COUNCIL",
               "Greenville City Hall, Council Chambers, 206 S. Main Street",
               "CALL TO ORDER",
               "INVOCATION",
               "APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES",
               "COMMUNICATIONS / ANNOUNCMENTS FROM THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL",
               "CITIZENS WISHING TO ADDRESS COUNCIL",
               "Formal Agenda Minutes",
               "CONSENT AGENDA",
               "There will be not discussion of Consent Agenda items unless a Council member",
               "requests in which event the item in question will be considered separately",
               "UNFINISHED BUSINESS",
               " - (Ordinances - Second and Final Reading",
               "NEW BUSINESS",
               " - (Resolutions - First and Final Reading",
               "REGULAR AGENDA",
               " - (Ordinances - First Reading", 
               "STAFF REPORTS",
               "There being no further business, the meeting adjorned at",
               "MEETING NOTICE POSTED", "AND MEDIA NOTIFIED ON", 
               "CAMILLA G. PITMAN, MMC", "Certified PLS CITY CLERK")
              
stop_words = c("the","to","of","for","br","this","for","in","a","b","and","on","is","by",
               "that","with","from","as","it","are","have","be","us","an","was","u","i")

print(minutes2023)

```
